<decisions>
1. All MVP features must be implemented — even in the simplest version.
2. The key MVP functionality is CRUD for notes. The preferences profile and authentication are secondary, but also mandatory.
3. Users will register and log in with a simple email + password form (no OAuth).
4. Notes must include a trip title/location to make management and identification easier.
5. User preferences are limited to a few basic attributes: travel style, type of accommodation, climate/destination.
6. Information on the number of days and people should be provided separately, not inside the note content.
7. Generated travel plans will have a day-by-day structure if the user provides the number of days; otherwise — a list of activities.
8. The app will be available in English only — no internationalization support at this stage.
9. No usage limits are planned for AI.
10. Statistics will be collected on accepted and rejected plans, with an optional reason for rejection.
11. Timelines and costs are irrelevant — the focus is on a clear breakdown of requirements and a logical PRD structure.

<matched_recommendations>
1. Introduce a minimal note structure with title/location — to ease identification and organization.
2. Collect user preferences in a simplified structure (travel style, climate, accommodation, regions).
3. Allow entry of basic trip parameters (days, number of people) in a dedicated form before creating a Plan.
4. Define a logical format for the generated plan — daily or list-based, depending on input data.
5. Simple authentication system: login via email and password.
6. No onboarding — but encourage filling in preferences before generating a plan via a prompt, e.g., a warning.
7. No internationalization — the app in English only.
8. A mechanism to track plan acceptances/rejections — with an option for the user to justify the decision.
9. No limits on AI queries — simplifying the MVP.
10. Prioritization — full notes CRUD as the absolute foundation, AI editing as optional.

<prd_planning_summary>
**Main product functional requirements:**
- Simple registration/login system (email + password).
- Ability to create, edit, view, and delete notes.
- A plan-generation form using AI that considers notes and user preferences.
- A user profile page containing travel preferences.
- Ability to accept/reject plans and save reasons for rejection.
- Presentation of plans in a day-by-day structure or as a list (when the number of days is missing).

**Key user stories:**
- A user creates an account, fills in preferences, saves a note, and generates a travel plan with AI.
- A user (without a completed profile) creates a note and generates a travel plan — the app informs them that completing preferences can improve personalization.
- A user browses the history of plans and accepts/rejects generated proposals, optionally providing a reason for rejection.

**Important success criteria and how to measure them:**
- 90% of users have filled in their travel preferences.
- 75% of users generate 3 or more plans per year.
- Data for these metrics is collected in the database, along with information on plan acceptance and rejection.

<unresolved_issues>
1. Can notes be archived or grouped into folders/travel projects?  
Not at this time — let’s provide only add, delete, and update options for notes, nothing more.

2. Will the user be able to add more than one note to a single travel plan?  
Yes.

3. How is the technical handling of multiple plans generated simultaneously (e.g., only one active loading tile)?  
Handling multiple plans simultaneously is possible without issues. They will be separate jobs.

4. Do you anticipate dark/light mode or any customization of the app’s appearance to user preferences?  
Yes — let’s support simple theming in the project.

5. Does accepting a plan mean it’s saved as “ready to execute,” and can it be edited later?  
Accepting a plan means leaving it as ready to execute; however, the user can always edit the plan’s information.
